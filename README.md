This will be hopefully app to help me track maintenance of my bicycle

what it should do:
- store photo of bike
- store components list
- store setup of bike categorized by components
- store history of setup and components
- show everything in nice gui

what it could do also:
- look up for new replacement components on web (from the list of favorite shops)
- show prices and availability of such components
- provide tips on maintenance

what would be nice in future:
- link with tracking app like strava and track the wear of components
